Hi NESC3505!

Welcome to my Demo 5. Although masks are a simple concept, I feel like they can be a very useful tool for future coding.

I wanted to compile what I've learned about masks and see how they could be applied to different datasets other than in biomedical imaging. 

Hope this is helpful to you as well!
